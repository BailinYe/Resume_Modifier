After testing all components, document any error messages (if present), diagnose the root cause of the issues, list all potential contributing factors, and determine whether they can be resolved.

Based on the functional specifications, analyze whether the issues lie in the testing phase or the implementation phase.
Please assist me in resolving these issues one by one.

Assist me in resolving these issues to ensure that Docker containers with all functional features operational can run successfully.

Diagnose the cause of the error, list all potential contributing factors, and determine whether they can be resolved.

Help me resolve these issues

then organize and categorize all test files and documentation, consolidating files with identical functions into unified folders.

If the issue has been resolved, please document the measures you took in the Markdown file to record the root cause and the correct solution.
run the docker with all the functional feature working



Add new functionality to the backend API:
As a user, I want to be able to recover my password via email verification when I forget it.

How should this new feature be designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing project while maintaining consistency?

Based on the above requirements, please incorporate them into my functional specification document with detailed and precise instructions.

And then Break down tasks according to requirements and implement new features using a test-driven development approach.

Use task tracking documents to record all items to ensure progress is made.


Optimize and standardize my prompt to enable more structured and precise task decomposition and execution.

TODO:
Continue completing the remaining tasks. Good luck, and thank you!
